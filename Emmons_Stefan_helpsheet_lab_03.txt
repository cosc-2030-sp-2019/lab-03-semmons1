The only python modules I had to import for this lab was the module "operator". 
The ops variable is actually a dictionary. This is something that is relatively native to Python, and is very similar to a set or class in C++. 
The main purpose of dictionaries is to map key values, such as operators in the case of this lab.
Python has lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples. These are the most commonly used "container" data structures used within Python.
